    <p>My theme is "A Brand New Day." I chose this because I can break it up into small chunks for each week (my thought so far anyway).</p>
    <p>I also chose this them because I have taken this class twice before, and can't use the first few themes I tried. I regretted choosing the theme directly after submitting it though, because I noticed a large percentage of the class chose the same thing (wish I would have looked at that first). Hopefully, I will not have it be too boring and make you feel like you are looking at the same thing over and over.</p>
    <p>Thanks to some great insight provided by the teacher from last month, Jen McCarrick, I have figured out a lot of what befuddled me in the two times I took the class prior (Thank you to her!).</p>
